RePT Public Transport Recap

# Features
RePT allows you to record and search through your trips on public transport. Store trip details such as the vehicle number, route, and date then conveniently find them at a later date. With RePT, you'll be able to quickly recall details about your past trips and view it in an easy way. 

# Getting started
Getting started with RePT is very simple. All you need to do is download the python file and run it. V2.2.1 and later works straight out of the box so you can immediately get to recording your trips. If you already have a formatted spreadsheet, you can download it as a .CSV file and open it with RePT. Just make sure to set it as the source and set the column names in settings.

# Searching for trips
RePT offers a powerful search tool to allow you to conveniently search through your logged trips. To get started, open the search menu and type in your desired search term into the appropriate box and then press the search button beside that box. The results will then appear on the right side of the screen. It is possible to search by vehicle, route, date, and service ID.

# Logging trips
RePT features a convenient menu for recording trip details. Simply enter the details in the boxes and press log to store it in the program. The vehicle and route boxes automatically clear when you press log while the date persists. As soon as your trip is logged, it can be searched for within the program or edited. Once you have logged your trips in the program, press the save button to save the trips to a file. This allows you to close the program without losing your recorded trips. 

# Editing trips
If you ever incorrectly enter trip details, don't worry because RePT supports trip editing. Simply enter the service ID and press autofill to get all the trip details. The service ID is provided when you press log and can also be found when you search for trips. Editing is as simple as changing the details in the boxes and clicking edit. You can also delete trips in the same menu by pressing delete. Remember to press save so that your edits will remain after closing the program. 

# Settings
The settings menu allows you to change various settings in RePT. There are various themes which can be chosen from as well as the ability to change the file which data is saved to. If you'd like to create a separate file for a specific trip, simply change the source and relaunch. Remember to click save to update your settings so they are applied on next launch.
